# This file is a placeholder for Gatekeeper installation
# In practice, you would install Gatekeeper using:
# kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper/release-3.14/deploy/gatekeeper.yaml

# Note: The actual Gatekeeper installation should be done via the official manifests
# or Helm chart for production use. This file is kept for reference only.
# The setup scripts will install Gatekeeper automatically.
